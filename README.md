# F1
An analysis of F1 results over time

Data sourced from Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020

Project Plan:
2022/02/13

Graph races by Country, track and year
Constructor race wins per track - per era
Driver races wins per era
	Create data on era


data story:
hypothesis - the frquency of races at a certain track gives a certain constructor an edge in the championship
show this by
frequency of races at a each track
constructor dominance at each track (win/points accumulated at each track)
amount of constructor bias tracks in a year the championship was won (if 5 tracks bias merc each year as opposed to two that bias Ferrari)

Other ideas:
constructor or driver dominance over the years
- look at things like time margins to p2 or team mate
- points margins from p2 or team mate
- cummulative points over time
